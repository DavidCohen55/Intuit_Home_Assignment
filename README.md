# Intuit_Home_Assignment
The 2 missions were split into directories:
- API, which contains the code for the API and the risk analysis I've implemented using Flask, sqlAlchemy, Kafka, and PostgresSql
  - the API part, I've created the db_models which defines the database structure and creates them using sqlAlchemy
  - the risk analysis part, I've implemented a basic risk assessment that generates a number between 1 and 0 and accordingly decides if approved or rejected 
- Spark, contains the notepad I've written in Google Colab
